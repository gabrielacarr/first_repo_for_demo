mkdir: creates new directory/folder
touch: creates new file (do not forget extension : .txt, .html, .js)
ls: lists directories and files (visible ones)
.. : moves one level up

git init: initialize git
git add name_of_what_youre_adding (or " . " for all) 
git status: shows if there's anything to add, all the git pending activity
git commit -m"describe what you did with as much detail as possible": saves pieces of code that make sense as a chunk


Create new repo: click button "new" > "create repository"
Copy paste stuff into the terminal (if starting from zero, paste the whole thing)


Every time you save, you should add
You should commit when the chunk of code makes sense
Push when you have a stable version
